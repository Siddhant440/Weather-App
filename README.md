# Weather App 
by Siddhant Bisht

This weather app offers a seamless and visually appealing experience for users to access real-time weather information. Leveraging the power of Dart and Flutter, the app integrates with the OpenWeather API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather data.
Upon launching the app, users are greeted with an intuitive interface designed for simplicity and functionality. The home screen showcases the current weather conditions of a default city, accompanied by a visually striking weather icon, temperature, and a brief description of the weather condition. Users can easily navigate through the app, with a search bar allowing them to explore weather details for different cities.
